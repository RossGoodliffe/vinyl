# React Records
---

This is a React app that displays all the vinyl records I have, mainly used as a personal libary.
Each record will have information about the album and a track list avaliable.

The Django Rest Framework is being used to serve all the data for the records using React on the frontend.

## This app is still under development and is not currently live.
